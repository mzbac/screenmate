    <h1>ScreenMate AI Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> [Date]</p>

    <p>Thank you for using ScreenMate AI! This Privacy Policy describes how your personal information is handled when you use our macOS application ("App").</p>

    <h2>Data We Do Not Collect</h2>
    <p>ScreenMate AI is designed with your privacy as a priority. We <strong>do not</strong> collect, store, or transmit any of of your personal content, including but not limited to:
        <ul>
            <li>The content of your screenshots.</li>
            <li>The custom prompts you enter.</li>
            <li>Any text or data derived from your images or prompts during local VLM processing.</li>
        </ul>
    All image capture and VLM processing occur <strong>entirely on your device</strong>.
    </p>

    <h2>Data We Process Locally</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Screenshots:</strong> When you initiate a screenshot, the image data is captured into your device's memory (via the system clipboard as an intermediate step) and processed locally by the on-device Vision Language Model (VLM). This data does not leave your device.</li>
        <li><strong>Custom Prompts:</strong> Text prompts you provide are also processed locally with the screenshot data.</li>
        <li><strong>VLM Model Preference:</strong> If you select a specific VLM model from the provided list, this preference may be stored locally on your device for your convenience.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Network Activity</h2>
    <p>ScreenMate AI requires an internet connection for the following purpose ONLY:
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Downloading Vision Language Models (VLMs):</strong> When you select a VLM model for the first time, or when a default model is initially set up, the app will download the necessary model files from Hugging Face Hub (a reputable open-source model repository) or other specified model sources. This download is for the functionality of the app (the AI models themselves) and does not involve the transmission of your personal data or screenshot content.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    
    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
     <ul>
        <li><strong>Hugging Face Hub:</strong> Used for downloading VLM models. Their terms and privacy policy may apply to the model download process itself. ScreenMate AI does not share your personal data with Hugging Face Hub.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.</p>
